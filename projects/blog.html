    <p> The first thing that I learned in HTML was the basic script. First, we had to write !DOCTYPE html between a pair of these < >. This is so the computer knows its reading HTML and not any other language. Inside those, the computer needs to know what text is html, to we type html between a pair of these < >. Every command in html has to be typed between a pair of these < >. The computer then recoignizes this and decides what to do. After every command, you have to type the closing statement, which is just the repeat of the command but with a backslash. For example, when opening a paragraph, you type p and when closing a paragraph, you type /p. </p>

 <p> What I'm looking forward to learning in HTML is how to set tables, divisions, and more, and make my website look good with the HTML part. I want to learn how to connect my HTML with my CSS. More complex HTML would be fun to learn because I find it interesting and a cool language. </p>

    <h2 id="CSS1"> CSS Blog #1 </h2>
<p> The first thing I learned in CSS is how to change color. To change color, you simply open a CSS style sheet in HTML and choose what you want to color (or what background). Type the HTML command without the < > inside the style sheet and type a curly bracket { }. Inside those brackets, type the command color followed by a colon : and then rgb. rgb sets the color of a pixel with red, green, and blue values. In the rgb section, type your r, g and b values from 0-255 to set the intensisy of the color in the pixel. This makes for a pretty versatile set of colors. </p>

<p> What I look forward to learning is CSS is more complex styling. This includes ifs. For example, if I hover over a link, it changes color. This would be very fun to learn because I can do lots of things with CSS. I can completely change how a website looks with just changing CSS. CSS is the most important part of websites in my opinion, because without a good style, websites do not transmit the same good feeling of good coding. </p>
