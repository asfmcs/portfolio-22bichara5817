If you zoom in on a map, you can see a gap between the mainland and the <em> Zona Hotelera. </em> In the image below, the little strip of land on the bottom part of the map is the <em> Zona Hotelera</em>, while the top part is the Cancún mainland. Boulevard Kukulkan travels through the <em> Zona Hotelera </em>of Cancún and provides beautiful sights of the beaches and the horizon. <br>
